JavaFinalProject
================

PokerGame By Rodrigo Penide.

This game is a final project for my course CS110 Intermediate Java Programming at University of Vermont (USA).

NOTE: If going to run the program in JGrasp you are not going to be able to run it with the "run" tool. Use the debug mode in 
automatic. Best option is to run it through the console.

How to run the game:

The main method is in MainDriver.java, run the program from there.
At the beginning is going to let you introduce the name of the players. After introducing them the windows are going to be created
Place the windows in the most confortable way you consider and press ok in the dialog boxes that are showing.
After this the cards will be dealed and the Small and big blind are going to be already posted so the next player begins.
To know whose turn it is, the player with the downpanel of the window in red is the one to make the movement.


NOTE2: Considerations with the movements:
      Illegal movements will be considered as FOLD (there is a note in the uppanel of the window)
      To Call just press call.
      To Raise type the amount to raise in the left down part of the window. It will equal the biggest bet and then raise the
      specified amount over it.
      Check is the typical check movement in Poker.
      Pass is FOLD.
      
The bets for each betround are posted in the right part under "PLAYERS"
The total Pot of the hand is posted over "PLAYERS"


ENJOY YOUR GAME
